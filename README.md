This is a Contact App. In this Applicarion you can save Contact Details with Photos, Name, Phone number, Email.

This Application is created in Kotlin with MVVM Architecture.

The MVVM pattern helps cleanly separate an application's business and presentation logic from its user interface (UI). 
Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and the UI helps address numerous development issues and makes an application easier to test, maintain, and evolve. 
It can also significantly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to collaborate more easily when developing their respective parts of an app.

There are three core components in the MVVM pattern: the model, the view, and the view model. 
Each serves a distinct purpose. The diagram below shows the relationships between the three components.
