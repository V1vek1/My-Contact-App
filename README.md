This Application is created in Kotlin with MVVM Architecture.

The MVVM pattern helps cleanly separate an application's business and presentation logic from its user interface (UI). 
Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and the UI helps address numerous development issues and makes an application easier to test, maintain, and evolve. 
It can also significantly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to collaborate more easily when developing their respective parts of an app.

There are three core components in the MVVM pattern: the model, the view, and the view model. 
Each serves a distinct purpose. The diagram below shows the relationships between the three components.
